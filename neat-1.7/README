Overview
========

NEAT is a program for calculating chemical abundances in photoionised nebulae.  It can propagate uncertainties and compensate for measurement biases affecting weak lines.

The code includes the necessary atomic data files, but you might also wish to use some different atomic data sets which are available separately in the Atomic-data repository.

Installation
============

It should be possible to compile the code simply by typing 

  make

in the directory the files are in.  Our makefile assumes that you have gfortran installed.  Other compilers should work as well but may require some tweaks to the code.
